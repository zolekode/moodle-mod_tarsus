**mod_tarsus** is the Tarsus learning activity for Moodle. Teachers add it to a course like any other activity, pick which pages, files and links the coach may use, and learners get a tutor that is available around the clock: it builds knowledge in small units, tests it with exam-style tasks at the right difficulty, and answers questions in the learner's own words – with the calculation path when the question is a task. Progress and experience points flow into the gradebook and activity completion.

The activity builds on the connector plugin **[local_tarsus](https://github.com/lernlink/moodle-local_tarsus)**, which holds the credentials, indexes the course material and guards every outbound call. Both plugins are free and open source; Tarsus itself is billed by usage.

> **No secrets in this repository.** There are **no API keys and no brain IDs** in the code, the history or the screenshots. The credentials for a real brain are entered once by an administrator in the connector's site settings; they are stored in the Moodle database and are never shown to teachers or learners. Without them the plugins run in **mock mode** with simulated answers, so you can explore every screen before you [request access](#getting-access).

## What the coach does

The pictures in this section are Tarsus product visuals and show the coach in the Tarsus web app. The Moodle activity offers the same three modes in Moodle's own look; see [Inside Moodle](#inside-moodle) for screenshots of the plugin itself.

### Three ways to learn

| Build knowledge | Test knowledge | Ask a question |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| <img src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/s0fmuHNzzQzugFWdZ64BNRzBZVE.webp" alt="Explanation card built from the course material" width="400"> | <img src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/hgagwUKE5rL19zOgU4zCXHDL8wk.webp" alt="Spreadsheet task with line-by-line feedback" width="400"> | <img src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Gg6PdLZrXoksmnEkebq2iomzcCM.webp" alt="The coach answers a question and shows the calculation path" width="400"> |
| Learning units with objectives, explanation cards and check questions, optionally read aloud. One idea at a time, with examples for the target group. | Tasks like in the exam: single choice, true/false, open questions, rule of three, spreadsheet calculations and accounting exercises – with feedback that says what is still missing, experience points and a progress bar. | Questions in the learner's own words, answered from the included material only. Learners can also ask about any learning card or task ("Ask about this"). |

Teachers switch each mode on or off per activity; learners switch between the enabled modes at the bottom of the chat.

### Graphics, simulations and 3D models on demand

| | | |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| <img src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Cosivt9X6HrNKgVnRe4uAuwSXI.webp" alt="Rotatable 3D cylinder with diameter and height" width="400"> | <img src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/uZ93hce6VN7ddmDdqNunRz8mg.webp" alt="Interactive characteristic curve: a slider moves the operating point" width="400"> | <img src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/XuhQqOxDZ7REyDl40HnvMnVjpms.webp" alt="Decision tree: what does the body orbit?" width="400"> |
| **3D models** that learners can turn and measure. | **Simulations** where a slider changes the physics and the result follows. | **Diagrams and animations** drawn for the question at hand. |

With the *Agent-driven* interaction type the coach answers inside Moodle with interactive cards of this kind. See [Interaction types](#interaction-types).

### Many task formats

| Single choice with an explanation | Open questions with partial credit | True or false | Rule of three, spreadsheet calculations and accounting exercises |

### The right level for every person

The coach adapts to the **DQR level**, the **taxonomy stages** (knowledge, understanding, application), the **learning pace** and the **target group** that the teacher sets per activity, and to the **task operators** (standard or the four IHK operators). Which task comes next is decided from the learner's answers – the same idea as in item response theory – so strong learners are stretched and nobody is left behind. Read more in the Tarsus [Praxiswissen](https://tarsus.ai/praxiswissen) articles and watch the explainers under [Watch](#watch).

## Inside Moodle

The learner side, taken in the plugin on Moodle 5.3 with a live Tarsus brain (course language English; the coach answers in the learner's language):

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/14_test_open_question.jpg" alt="Test knowledge in Moodle: an open question is answered, scored with 55 % and the feedback says what is still missing; the mode switcher and the experience points sit at the bottom" width="900">
</p>

| Build knowledge | Test knowledge | Ask about a task |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/11_build_learning_card_audio.jpg" alt="A learning unit below its objectives, with the narration player and previous/next navigation" width="440"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/13_test_single_choice.jpg" alt="A single-choice question, answered correctly, with its explanation" width="440"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/15_ask_about_a_task.jpg" alt="The learner asks what is still missing in an answer and then for a simpler explanation; the coach answers both" width="440"> |
| Learning units card by card, read aloud on request. | Tasks with a verdict, an explanation and experience points. | "What is still missing in my answer?" and "Please explain it more simply." after a task. |

With the *Agent-driven* interaction type a leading question is enough – "show me this in 3D", "give me an interactive comparison table", "explain it with an animated diagram" – and the coach builds the card inside the Moodle chat:

| 3D model | Interactive comparison table | Animated diagram |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/16_agent_3d_model.jpg" alt="Show me the Solar System in 3D: a model the learner can turn with the mouse or the arrow keys" width="440"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/17_agent_comparison_table.jpg" alt="An interactive comparison table of the eight planets, sortable by column" width="440"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/18_agent_animated_diagram.jpg" alt="An animated top-view diagram of the planets orbiting the Sun, with a pause button" width="440"> |
| "Show me the Solar System in 3D so I can turn it." | "Give me an interactive comparison table of the planets." | "Explain with an animated diagram how the planets orbit the Sun." |

| Slider simulation | Clickable graphic | Step-by-step calculation |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/19_agent_interactive_slider.jpg" alt="A slider picks a planet and shows its distance from the Sun and its orbital period" width="440"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/20_agent_labelled_graphic.jpg" alt="A labelled cross-section of the Sun whose layers can be selected one by one" width="440"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/21_agent_step_by_step.jpg" alt="The distance of Mars from the Sun, calculated in three numbered steps" width="440"> |
| "Make it interactive: a slider for the distance from the Sun…" | "Show the layers of the Sun as a labelled graphic I can click through." | "…Show the calculation step by step." |

| Learning objectives | Dark mode |
|:--:|:--:|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/10_build_objectives.jpg" alt="The learning objectives of a course with their taxonomy levels" width="640"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/22_dark_mode.jpg" alt="Practice cards in the site's dark colour mode" width="640"> |
| Build knowledge opens with the objectives the coach derived from the material. | The cards follow the site's light or dark colour mode. |

The teacher side – the material tab, the activity settings and the site-wide connection (shown in mock mode, so every field is a placeholder):

| Material tab | Activity settings |
|:--:|:--:|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/02_material_tab.png" alt="The material tab lists the pages, files and URLs of the course with their index state, an include switch and re-index and remove actions" width="640"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/03_settings_general.png" alt="Activity settings: interaction type, DQR level, taxonomy levels, target group, cheat prevention and the Ask a question options" width="640"> |
| Every page, file and URL of the course with its state in the brain. Switch it on to let the coach use it. | Interaction type, DQR level, taxonomy levels, target group – and one section per mode. |

The ideas behind the coach, explained in short articles with videos:

- **[Item response theory with AI](https://tarsus.ai/praxiswissen/item-response-theory)** – why the coach weighs ability and task difficulty instead of counting right answers, and how that picks the next task.
- **[Taxonomies in e-learning](https://tarsus.ai/praxiswissen/dihk-taxonomie-stufen)** – thinking levels and knowledge types after Anderson & Krathwohl, and the "knowledge cube" the coach uses to see strengths, gaps and learning paths.
- **[The learning rate](https://tarsus.ai/praxiswissen/lernrate-adaptives-lernen)** – how adaptive learning updates a learner's level after each answer, and why surprising answers count more.
- **[DQR levels](https://tarsus.ai/praxiswissen/dqr-niveaus)** · **[Avoiding AI hallucinations](https://tarsus.ai/praxiswissen/ki-halluzinationen)** · **[Exam simulations](https://tarsus.ai/praxiswissen/pruefungssimulation-erstellen)** · all articles: [Praxiswissen](https://tarsus.ai/praxiswissen)

## Getting access

The plugins need a Tarsus brain: the API base URL, an **API key** and a **brain ID**. These are issued by Tarsus for your organisation – they are not in this repository and not in any release. Two ways to get the plugin into your Moodle, same plugin either way:

- **Through lern.link**, the integration partner for Moodle: lern.link installs and configures the plugins in your Moodle, advises on the didactic setup and supports the rollout. Write to [info@lernlink.de](mailto:info@lernlink.de?subject=Tarsus%20for%20Moodle), call +49 8152 909090 or visit [lern.link](https://lern.link/).
- **Directly from Tarsus:** write to [info@tarsus.ai](mailto:info@tarsus.ai?subject=Tarsus%20for%20Moodle) or [book an introductory call](https://outlook.office.com/book/Erstgespraech@tarsus.ai/) – 45 minutes, with a course from your own field. More about the product and the plugin on [tarsus.ai/moodle-ki-plugin](https://tarsus.ai/moodle-ki-plugin).

Also good to know:

- **Try the coach first:** a free account on [zero.tarsus.ai](https://zero.tarsus.ai/) lets you upload your own documents and talk to the coach before anything is installed.
- **Pay as you grow:** the plugins cost nothing; Tarsus is billed by usage. Start with one course and extend as needed.
- **On-premise:** Tarsus can also deploy the entire Tarsus stack on your own infrastructure if your organisation requires it. [Talk to us](mailto:info@tarsus.ai?subject=Tarsus%20on-premise).

Until a brain is configured the plugins run in **mock mode** with simulated answers, so administrators and teachers can explore every screen.

## The plugin set

| Plugin | Role | Repository |
|---|---|---|
| **mod_tarsus** (this plugin) | The learning activity: ask, test, build knowledge; material tab; grades and completion | this repository |
| **local_tarsus** | The connector: credentials, brain selection, material indexing, guardrails, mock mode. **Required.** | [lernlink/moodle-local_tarsus](https://github.com/lernlink/moodle-local_tarsus) |
| block_tarsus | Course block with the learner's standing and a teacher summary. Optional. | [lernlink/moodle-block_tarsus](https://github.com/lernlink/moodle-block_tarsus) |
| report_tarsus | Course report (early stage). Optional. | [lernlink/moodle-report_tarsus](https://github.com/lernlink/moodle-report_tarsus) |

Install the connector first; the other plugins declare a dependency on it.

## Requirements

- **Moodle 5.0 or later**, tested on 5.2 and 5.3; **PHP 8.2 or later**.
- **local_tarsus** installed and configured (or in mock mode).
- **MathJax filter for formulas.** The brain writes formulas in TeX with single-dollar delimiters (`$V=2\cdot7$`). Enable the *MathJax loader* filter and add the delimiters to its *MathJax configuration* (Site administration › Plugins › Filters › MathJax loader):

  ```json
  {"tex":{"inlineMath":[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],"displayMath":[["$$","$$"],["\\[","\\]"]],"processEscapes":true}}
  ```

## Installation

Four steps – the first one installs the connector, the next three this activity.

### 1. Install and configure local_tarsus

1. Unzip [local_tarsus](https://github.com/lernlink/moodle-local_tarsus) into `local/tarsus` (Moodle 5.1 or later: `public/local/tarsus`), or add its repository as a Git submodule at that path.
2. Visit *Site administration › Notifications* to install it.
3. Open *Site administration › Plugins › Local plugins › Tarsus* and enter the **API key** and **base URL** you received from Tarsus or lern.link, then pick your brain on the *Tarsus brains* page. No credentials yet? Tick **Mock mode** instead – everything works with simulated answers.

### 2. Put this plugin in place

Unzip the activity into `mod/tarsus` (Moodle 5.1 or later: `public/mod/tarsus`), or add the repository as a Git submodule at that path:

```bash
# Moodle 5.0
git clone https://github.com/lernlink/moodle-mod_tarsus mod/tarsus
# Moodle 5.1 or later
git clone https://github.com/lernlink/moodle-mod_tarsus public/mod/tarsus
```

The folder must be called `tarsus` – Moodle derives the plugin name from it.

### 3. Install it in Moodle

Visit *Site administration › Notifications* and confirm the upgrade. Moodle creates the tables and the capabilities; the activity *Tarsus* then appears in the activity chooser of every course.

### 4. Add the activity to a course

1. Turn on edit mode in a course and add a **Tarsus** activity. Give it a name such as *AI learning coach*; the defaults suit most courses, and every setting can be changed later (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
2. Open the activity. The **material tab** lists the pages, files and URLs of the course. Click *Index this page* (or *Index* per item) and switch the items **on** that the coach may use.
3. Let the indexing finish – the status column turns to *Indexed* – and try the chat preview below the table.

That's it. Learners open the activity and meet the coach; teachers see the material tab and the chat preview, learners only the chat.

### Updating

Replace the folder with the new version (or `git pull` in it) and visit *Site administration › Notifications* again. Settings and learner progress are kept.

## First steps in a course

- **Choose the material deliberately.** The coach answers only from what is switched on. Start with the core script and the exercises; leave out organisational pages.
- **Set the level.** The DQR level, the taxonomy levels and the target group tell the coach whom it is talking to. The task operators (standard or IHK) shape how questions are phrased.
- **Pick the interaction type.** *AI manager-driven* keeps to text answers and the slide cards you configured; *Agent-driven* lets the coach build interactive cards itself. See [Interaction types](#interaction-types).
- **Use the preview.** Below the material table the teacher gets the same chat as the learners, so answers can be checked without leaving the page.
- **Edited a page?** The connector re-indexes it in the background; a deleted item is untracked. *Sync this page with the brain* brings the whole list up to date at once.

## Configuration

### Site settings (local_tarsus)

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| API key, Brain ID, Base URL | The connection. One brain per site; the key is stored site-wide and never shown to teachers or learners. |
| Tarsus brains | A page listing every brain the key can reach, with its state, to pick the one the site uses. |
| Assistant name, ID, description, avatar | How the assistant appears in the chat. |
| Voice selection, Voice | The voice that reads learning units aloud: by the learner's language, or one fixed voice. |
| Mock mode | Serve all calls from the built-in mock – for trying the plugins without a Tarsus account. |
| Kill switch, Rate limit, Credit budget | Guardrails: block every outbound call at once; cap calls per minute; cap AI credits per period. |

### Activity settings (mod_tarsus)

Every Tarsus activity has its own settings in four sections:

| Section | Settings |
|---|---|
| **AI settings: general** | *Interaction type* (AI manager-driven or Agent-driven) · *Difficulty level (DQR)* from 2-year vocational training to Master Professional · *Taxonomy levels* (knowledge, understanding, application) · *Target group* as free text, e.g. a trade · *Cheat prevention* |
| **AI settings: Ask a question** | *Enable* · *Conversation style*: closed, lexical, tutorial, Socratic or open |
| **AI settings: Test knowledge** | *Enable* · *Task operators*: standard or IHK (name, describe, explain, elaborate) · *Question types* per difficulty grade (easy, medium, hard) out of single choice, true/false, open question, rule of three, spreadsheet calculation and accounting exercise (Buchhaltung) · *Learning pace* from ×0.1 to ×2 |
| **AI settings: Build knowledge** | *Enable* · *Add GIFs* · *Didactic concept* (micro-learning) |

At least one mode must be enabled, and every difficulty grade needs at least one question type. The usual Moodle sections follow: availability, restrict access, completion (including *Progress reached*), tags and competencies.

### Material tab

| Column / action | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Status | *Not indexed*, *Pending*, *Awaiting confirmation*, *Indexed*, *Content changed* (edited since indexing), *Pending removal* or *Error* – with a *Retry* action where one helps. |
| Included | Switch an indexed item on or off for this activity. Only indexed items can be included. |
| Index, Re-index, Remove | Send an item to the brain, send it again after edits, or untrack it. |
| Index this page, Sync this page with the brain | Bulk actions for the items on the current page of the list (the brain accepts up to 10 resources per call). |

### Reset a learner's chat

The *Reset chat history* tab (capability `mod/tarsus:resetchat`) erases the **current user's own** conversation with the coach, in the brain as well – for example after a teacher has tried the activity or given a demo. Nobody can erase another person's conversation, and learners cannot erase theirs at all, because the conversation carries their learning progress.

## Interaction types

| Type | Who shapes the answer | What learners see |
|---|---|---|
| **AI manager-driven** (default) | The configuration: conversation style, learning method, question types. | Text answers and slide cards – predictable, close to the material. |
| **Agent-driven** | The Tarsus agent decides how to answer. | Interactive cards built for the question: simulations with sliders, animated diagrams, 3D models, step-by-step calculations – rendered inside the chat. |

Both types answer only from the included material.

## Grades, completion and progress

- **Progress** is the learner's standing in the activity; **experience points (XP)** are earned in *Test knowledge*. Both feed the gradebook.
- **Activity completion** can require a progress value (*Progress reached*), next to the usual manual or view-based completion.
- **Backup and restore** carry the settings and the included material; learner progress is restored when user data is included.
- The interface follows the site's light or dark colour mode and works on phones: on small screens the composer switches to icon-only buttons.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Default roles |
|---|---|
| `mod/tarsus:view` | Student, teacher, editing teacher, manager |
| `mod/tarsus:addinstance` | Editing teacher, manager |
| `mod/tarsus:manage` | Editing teacher, manager |
| `mod/tarsus:resetchat` | Teacher, editing teacher, manager |

## Data and privacy

- **What is sent to Tarsus:** the text and files of the included course material, the learners' questions and answers, the activity's title and settings, and a pseudonymous learner ID. The brain never receives names or e-mail addresses – each learner is identified by a per-site HMAC pseudonym.
- **Guardrails** on every call: a kill switch, a circuit breaker with capped backoff, a credit budget and a rate limit. A usage ledger records credits per context and user.
- **Privacy API:** the connector implements Moodle's privacy provider for the usage ledger and the pseudonyms; this activity implements it for the learners' progress records.
- The coach does not search the internet. Tarsus stores your content at Microsoft Azure in Germany, GDPR-compliant – and the entire stack can be deployed on-premise on request. Check your data processing agreement with Tarsus before enabling the plugins on a production site.

## Development

```bash
php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/init.php
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite mod_tarsus_testsuite
```

Unit tests run against the connector's mock client, so they need no Tarsus account. JavaScript lives in `amd/src` and is built with Moodle's grunt. The GitHub workflow runs moodle-plugin-ci on Moodle 5.2 and 5.3. Changes are listed in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).
