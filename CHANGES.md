# Changes

## 1.1.1 (2026-11-12)

- The accounting question type is labelled "Accounting exercise" (German: "Buchhaltung") in the activity settings; the request still sends `accountingWidget`.
- README lists the accounting exercise among the task formats.

## 1.1.0 (2026-11-10)

- New question type "Account Exercise" (accountingWidget) in the activity settings.
- Table questions follow the brain's table: its own column names and any number of columns, instead of the fixed Position / Rate / Amount layout.
- Web service change: `mod_tarsus_submit_practice_answer` takes table rows as `{cells: [...]}`; table rows in results are `{cells: [{value, ask, verdict}]}`.

## 1.0.2 (2026-11-06)

- Templates carry example contexts; ESLint-clean JavaScript (flattened promise chains); stylelint-clean CSS.

## 1.0.1 (2026-11-06)

- Database: industry and questiontypes are nullable, since XMLDB rejects NOT NULL char columns with an empty default on install.

## 1.0.0 (2026-11-06)

- First stable release prepared for the Moodle plugins directory.
- Interaction type setting per activity; interactive web cards for agent-driven activities.
- Responsive composer on phones: icon-only mode and send buttons.
- Dark colour mode support for all cards.
- Coding style aligned with moodle-cs; CI matrix covers Moodle 5.2 and 5.3.
